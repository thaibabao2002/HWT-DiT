(*) FID (FrÃ©chet Inception Distance): score >= 0 (the smaller, the better)
    Feature extraction is based on InceptionV3.

(*) HWD (Handwriting Distance): score >= 0 (the smaller, the better)
    Feature extraction is based on VGG16.
        Calculate the average of all features for each author in the real dataset (and similarly for fake).
        Then, compute the Euclidean distance between the two average vectors (real vs. fake) for each author to obtain an individual author score.
        HWD = mean(score) for all authors.

(*) CER (Character Error Rate): score in range [0, 1] (the smaller, the better)
